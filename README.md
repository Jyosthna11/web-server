# Secure Web Server

This is a secure web server developed using [programming language] (C++) that serves web pages to clients over the HTTP protocol. The server is designed to run on Linux, specifically on the provided Fedora Linux VM image, and compiles with the GCC or Clang/LLVM compiler.

## Features

- **GET Method**: The server supports the GET method for retrieving web pages and files.
- **File Serving**: The server can serve (transfer) files to the client, including files located in subdirectories.
- **Well-formed HTTP Response Headers**: The server sends appropriate HTTP response headers, including status codes 200 (OK) and 404 (Not Found).
- **Browser Rendering**: The server can serve HTML files that render correctly in common web browsers (e.g., Firefox or Chrome).
- **POST Method**: The server supports the POST method for handling web form submissions.
- **Form Handling**: The server can accept data via either GET or POST methods and save/store the submitted data.

## Security Considerations

Security has been a primary concern in the development of this web server. The following security features have been implemented:

## Compile the server:
g++ -o server main.cpp [other_files.cpp]

## Usage
1. Start the server:
 ## For C++
  2. ./server
    
3. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (or the appropriate port specified in your server configuration).

4. You can now interact with the server by accessing web pages, submitting forms, and testing the various features implemented.
